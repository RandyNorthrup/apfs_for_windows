/// @file partition_export_containment.h
/// @brief The one containment guard every raw-filesystem exporter writes through.
///
/// The APFS, ext and HFS+ directory exporters all take a foreign, attacker-authorable volume and
/// write its contents into a directory the operator chose. Each carried its OWN byte-identical
/// copy of this logic, and that is not a hypothetical cost: R5-P4-44 (and R4 M-A4-27 before it)
/// exist because HFS+ was the copy that lagged, shipping without the containment re-check while
/// the other two had it. A guard maintained in triplicate is a guard that will diverge again, so
/// there is now one definition and the readers call it.
///
/// Header-only on purpose. The core sources are enumerated in the top-level CMakeLists AND
/// re-enumerated by roughly six test targets, so a new translation unit would have to be added to
/// each of them -- and a target that silently missed it would fail to link rather than quietly
/// lose the guard, but the churn buys nothing that `inline` does not.
